      {
        "question": "What information do you collect about me?",
        "answer": "We collect information you provide directly (like your email and payment info), information from your use of our service (like viewing history and device information), and information from third parties (like marketing partners). This helps us provide and improve our service."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will opting out affect my Netflix service?",
        "answer": "No, opting out will not affect your ability to use Netflix. You'll still be able to stream content, manage your account, and receive service-related communications. It only affects how we use your data for advertising and marketing purposes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to process my request?",
        "answer": "We aim to respond to all requests within 45 days. If we need more time (up to 90 days total), we'll let you know. For account deletion requests, we may take up to 30 days to complete the deletion after verification."
